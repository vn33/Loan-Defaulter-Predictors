# Loan Defaulters Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict loan defaulters using tree-based models. The model is trained on historical data containing features such as borrower information, loan details, and repayment behavior to classify whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan.

## Features

- **Tree-Based Models**: Utilizes decision tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for classification.
- **Feature Engineering**: Detailed feature engineering techniques are applied to preprocess the data, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, including statistical analysis and visualization, to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implements cross-validation to ensure robustness of the model.
- **Model Deployment**: Provides guidelines for deploying the trained model in a production environment.

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn



## Prepare Data:

Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Train the Model:

## Run the Jupyter notebook loan_defaulters_classifier.ipynb to train the model.
For better visualization, i recommend to run the notebook in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, perform detailed feature engineering, explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
